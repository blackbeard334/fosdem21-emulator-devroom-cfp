## Talk structure

A presentation consists of 2 or 3 parts:
- Talk(duh) - this is the **pre-recorded** portion of your talk
- Formal Q&A - this is the **live** Q&A session that happens after the pre-recorded part is finished
- Informal Q&A - this is an **optional** continuation of the Formal Q&A, that happens in a different room when the time is up

There are 2 important fields in penta regarding the duration of the talk:
- Duration - this is the total length of the allotted time slot(**Talk + Formal Q&A**)
- Presentation Length (without Q&A)	- well, this is basically the length of the **Talk** portion

###### Example:
- Start time = 12:00
- Duration = 30 minutes
- Presentation Length = 22 minutes

This means:
- at exactly 12:00 the pre-recorded video will start playing
- at 12:22:30 the stream will switch over to the live feed with the speaker & moderator/host for the **Formal Q&A**
- at 12:30 the speaker & audience will get a chance to switch to a different channel to continue the discussion(**Informal Q&A**), before the next pre-recorded video will start playing

There are currently 2 obvious ways to record the talks:
- Conference call record(**recommended**) - we would set up a call with one of the moderators/hosts, and record the online presentation(Jitsi, Zoom, Meets...etc)
- Record by yourself - meaning you as speaker are free to choose whatever software(OBS?) or green screen or what not to make the talk as fancy as possible
    - it is recommended that a moderator/host be present for this as well(four eyes principal)

Unless you want to show lots of live demos and do super fancy schmancy stuff, then a conference call recording will probably be sufficient.

### Tools to pre-record by yourself
So everybody is free to use whatever tool they want of course, but here are a couple of tips just in case:
- OBS studio - the de facto standard for recording stuff. for more info see https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/wiki/FOSDEM-2021-video-email-to-speakers & https://peertube.xwiki.com/videos/watch/c5cf50e3-2277-440a-b339-34874acd00b3
- Jitsi/Zoom/... - most videoconferencing software will allow you to do a solo call with screen sharing. They also provide built-in recording, so no extra screen capture software is needed. Example: https://blog.smu.edu/itconnect/2017/08/23/using-zoom-create-quick-easy-screen-recordings-free/


### Recording deadline
We haven't heard about the official deadline yet, but for the time being **January 17th 2021** will serve as our deadline.

#### How to upload the video?
You can upload videos by going to https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM21/events and selecting your event(talk).

Some things to keep in mind:
- The *Pre-recorded Video Upload URL	**Upload*** button doesn't look like a button :)
- Upload size limit = **1 GB**
- Processing time after upload could take about **100 minutes**
- The *Presentation Length* field is set automagically once the upload/processing is complete. **Do not edit manually afterwards.**
- The **Review button** will allow you to check and edit the video
  - It's still unclear how you replace an already uploaded video
- The uploaded video will be shown as is; so not framed in some sponsor laden frame or anything.

## How to live Q&A
    sources:
    - https://lists.fosdem.org/private/devroom-managers/2020-December/002175.html

The live Q&A will start with a Matrix chatroom during the talk, with the option to answer questions in the chat of course. And continues live with Jitsi after the talk is finished.

What you will need is:
- Matrix account & client - for more info see https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix
- Jitsi - they have some native clients, but the web client works just fine

#### Question: is this approach for both Formal & Informal Q&A?
The working assumption is yes, but we will add more details once they are known.
